Repository info:
This contains code for the first attempt at machine learning using python
Repository contains resrouce and working code for statistical model for prediction
There wont be any addtion to the code base of this repository, this would be used of reference purpose for other project

The project deals with estimating demand forecast using stats models like : Navie Bayes method, Rolling window average, Exponential smoothing, Holt double var exponential smoothing, Holt Winter triple var exponential smoothing and Auto-Arima

project_code: Predictors

Data: contains a zip file that needs to be extracted and then read in the code | contains the subset of the market demand file
python: two python code for implementing various models
python/gen_html: folder containing graphs created by plotly used to visualize the ML, currently in zipped format
